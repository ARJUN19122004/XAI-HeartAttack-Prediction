# *Heart Attack Risk Prediction Using Retinal Biomarkers and Explainable AI*

## *About the Project*

This project presents a machine learning–based system for predicting heart attack risk using non-invasive retinal fundus images. By extracting retinal vascular biomarkers such as CRAE, CRVE, AVR, vessel density, tortuosity, fractal dimension, and branch points, the system identifies early cardiovascular risk indicators. A Random Forest classifier is used for prediction, and Explainable AI (SHAP) is integrated to provide transparent and interpretable results for clinicians and users. This approach enables faster, non-invasive, and accessible cardiac risk screening.

## *Results and Impact*

The system demonstrates strong capability in evaluating cardiovascular risk using retinal biomarkers, offering a non-invasive, fast, and cost-effective alternative to conventional diagnostic methods. The integration of Explainable AI enhances clinical trust and provides insight into how each biomarker influences the prediction. This project contributes toward the development of accessible early-stage cardiovascular screening tools and can be extended for telemedicine applications.
